### description
i have been following too many twitter users, however, i just dont have the time to read all the related tweets but do not want to miss any tweet from import accounts. Therefore, i make this bot to only pull selected tweets (only most interested tweeter accounts), and push their tweets to telegram channel.

### disclaimer
this is a purely a personaly tool, it far away from a mature service.


### To Use
1. put your selected userlists under static/userList.json
2. ENV=local yarn start
